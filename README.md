OSM Bookmark Collection
=======================
This is a collection of bookmarks for use in Firefox and Chromium at trade fairs (e.g. Intergeo) and other events where OSM is presented to people outside the community (e.g. Linuxtag). This collection aims to contain a lot of important websites and maps of following categories:

* OSM-based maps (apart from simple maps overlaying OSM with own/propietary data)
* software for OSM data
* OSM-based commercial services (including company websites)
* documentation about OSM

This collection is very German-centric and contains only German descriptions.

Contributing
============
You can import the .html file into your Firefox. Please use a separate browser profile (start Firefox from Shell using `firefox --ProfileManager`).

Usage of Chromium/Google Chrome for contributing is not suggested.
