Please read the whole README file before commenting to any issue, opening a new one or submitting a pull request.

In addition to the desired content of this collection, here are some additional hints:

* Links to pages which are neither available in German nor in English will be rejected.
* Links to proprietary pages might be rejected if there is a suitable free and open source replacement.

This collection is no write-only collection. Your submission might be rejected because the aim of this collection is not to replace all these very long and unmaintained lists of links which are part of the OpenStreetMap wiki.
